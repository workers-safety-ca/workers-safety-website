+++ 
Marked annually in Canada on April 28th, the **National Day of Mourning** is dedicated to remembering those who have lost their lives, or suffered injury or illness due to a workplace tragedy.

First held in 1984 by the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), the Day of Mourning was adopted officially by the Canadian Labour Congress in 1986. More than 100 countries now observe the Day too.

The observance of this day is meant to honour the lives of workers lost, but it is also a collective committment to improving health and safety conditions in the workplace, and to prevent further injuries, illnesses, and deaths.

On **Sunday, April 28, 2024**, the Workers' Health and Safety Legal Clinic welcome all to reflect on this day. We encourage organizations, employees, communities, and individuals to hold or support an event, or to simply observe a moment of silence at 11am on April 28.

We all can look towards taking steps in creating a safer workplace:
* Educate yourself and others about health and safety rights, responsibilities and prevention measures
* Request training that supports the identification, assessment and control of workplace hazards
* Insist on effective workplace prevention programs developed with full worker participation
* Share information that highlights the need for continued efforts to stop preventable workplace injuries and deaths.
