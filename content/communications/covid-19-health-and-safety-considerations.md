Working during COVID-19, will depend on the type of work and its effect on public services. There are many workplaces that are considered [essential](https://www.ontario.ca/page/list-essential-workplaces "List of Essential Workplaces") including grocery stores, pharmacies and healthcare providers, that will require workers to come in despite the current government recommendations to avoid leaving home.

Under the _Occupational Health and Safety Act_ (OHSA), a worker has the right to ask their boss to take reasonable health and safety precautions in their workplace if there is a high likeliness of exposure to COVID-19.

The Workers' Health and Safety Legal Clinic has developed an information sheet to help workers' navigate their health and safety rights.
